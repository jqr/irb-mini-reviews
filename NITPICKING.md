# Does and Donts

* If you like something about a solution, give specific feedback. Just saying
"good job" or "nice work" is not positive, constructive feedback

* Give small suggestions or refactoring ideas, don't suggest a completely
different implementation

* Beginners do not have the same confidence level as more advanced folks, so
you should be courteous and considerate

* Try to give someone a chance to arrive at their own improvements

* It's okay to disagree, there are multiple correct answers to each exercise ("most 
readable", "simplist", "most performant", "most reusable")
