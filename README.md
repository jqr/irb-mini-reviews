# IndyRB Mini Code Reviews

The following programming exercises are from [exercism.io][ex], a practice tool to help
people write more clear and expressive code.

We will be doing a modified version of exercism.io's "nit-picking". We will break into
small groups, code up a solution that passes all the tests and then volunteer to have
our code reviewed by the group.

Do the exercises in the following order:

1. `bob`
2. `word-count`
3. `anagram`

Our goals for the night: practice writing expressive Ruby code, practice accepting feedback,
and practice giving respectful feedback.
